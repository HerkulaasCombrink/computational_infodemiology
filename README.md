# 🧠 Computational Infodemiology

Welcome to the **Computational Infodemiology** repository — an open research and analytics hub dedicated to understanding how **belief systems**, **misinformation**, and **crisis narratives** evolve and spread through digital platforms.

This project is part of the [Knowledge Mapping Labs](https://www.knowledgemappinglabs.com/home) and the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF)](https://www.ufs.ac.za/icdf) at the University of the Free State (UFS).

## 🔍 What Is Computational Infodemiology?

Computational Infodemiology is the **science of analysing information epidemics (infodemics)**. It blends:
- **Social media analytics**
- **Natural language processing (NLP)**
- **Topic modelling and sentiment analysis**
- **Network science**
- **Digital epidemiology**
- **Philosophy of belief systems**

Our goal is to detect, quantify, and model how harmful narratives and misinformation spread — and how they shape public perception, behaviour, and policy.

## 🧠 Focus: Mapping Belief Systems

We view infodemics not just as data problems, but as **belief ecosystems**. Our framework enables the tracking of:
- Collective anxieties
- Conspiratorial emergence
- Normative shifts in language and tone
- Crisis-based information seeking
- Value-laden misinformation (e.g., moral panic, identity politics)

We use **belief system mapping** to connect data points to social meaning:
- Topics → Themes of concern (e.g. vaccines, corruption)
- Sentiment → Affective load and urgency
- Trends → Search interest and public attention
- Co-occurrence networks → Semantic drift and agenda capture

This approach informs our dashboards, indicators, and models.

## 🖥️ Live App

📊 [**Computational Infodemiology Streamlit App**](https://computationalinfodemiology-9e3eekappqtf4tpzd37p7gh.streamlit.app/)

This Streamlit-powered dashboard allows you to:
- Visualise **real-time sentiment and stress** indicators
- Explore topic networks from social media
- Track public search behaviour via Google Trends
- Simulate how misinformation spreads across belief nodes

🚧 More modules are in development, including reinforcement learning simulations and misinformation heatmaps.
